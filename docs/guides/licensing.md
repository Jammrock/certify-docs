# About Licensing
Certify The Web and it's related services are a commercial product. A free community edition is available for download and evaluation (limited to a few managed certificates). 

You can purchase a license key which will then enable you to install the app on one or machines (depending on your license type). You can purchase multiple license keys to fit different sized installs and each install can manage an unlimited number of certificates through your choice of Certificate Authority.

You can review and manage your license keys and active installs via your certifytheweb.com profile under License Keys. 

There are two main methods of licensing:
- Purchased License Keys
- Cloud Managed Licenses

# Purchased License Keys
For the Certify The Web app you can currently purchase the following license key types:

| Type          | Renewal Frequency | Number of Installs| Price         |

These license key can be purchased using a credit card (via Stripe) or via PayPal.Proforma Invoicing, reseller accounts etc are not supported. 

License tier names are an arbitrary label and are not related to the size of your organisation, they are just a name for the license type. You can also get a link to send to someone else in your organisation to complete payment on behalf of your account.

Notifications are sent when your license key is about to expire. To stop receiving notifications about an expiring or expired license key, sign into your certifytheweb.com profile and choose `Cancel Now` from the License keys tab.

If you currently have a license key and want to renew your license at a lower tier, you can choose the `Downgrade Now` option. To upgrade a license type please contact support.


# Cloud Managed Licenses
An alternative to purchasing a license key is to have a license that's managed via a cloud subscription. We currently support Microsoft Azure subscriptions.

The benefits of a cloud managed license are:
- Billing is entirely integrated into your organisations existing cloud provider subscription.
- You have one product license key which you can apply to multiple installs.
- You can increase or decrease the number of installs required at any time. 
- Your organisation is only billed (by the cloud provider) for the number of installs you have set in your cloud subscription (pro rata per month).

Cloud subscription pricing varies by provider. The *number of licensed installs* set on your subscription is referred to by cloud providers as *Seats* or *Users*.

Note: If you license (for example) 10 installs but only actually install 9 you will be billed for 10. You can review your currently activated installs on your certifytheweb.com profile under License Keys. You cannot have a greater number of active installs than licensed installs.
