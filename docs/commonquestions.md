## I have 2 servers running the app.  Can the contact email can be the same on both?  
*Yes, the contact email can be the same on all servers, or you can vary it as required.* There is only one contact per server. The contact email used at the time of requesting a certificate remains fixed until that certificate expires. The email address is generally used by Let's Encrypt to warn you of expiring certificates you have not yet renewed. If you get emails for a certificate you no longer need you can just ignore them and they will stop when the certificate has expired.
