# What is Let's Encrypt?

Let's Encrypt is a free Certificate Authority (CA), and you can find out more details about them at https://letsencrypt.org

The *Certify SSL Manager* app and related *Certify The Web* related services use the Let's Encrypt service to acquire free certificates. There are many tools available on many operating systems. We focus on providing a UI for Windows to make the process easier and to take care of auto-renewal for you.
